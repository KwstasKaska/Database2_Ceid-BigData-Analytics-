# Database2_Ceid

Uni team project with @MarianniP.

We used Hadoop ecosystem, Apache HBASE and Apache PHOENIX frameworks.

We imported data from some csv files, that cannot be published, and then created some SQL queries to extract some specific data. 

At the end we tried to make these queries optimal so we used secondary indexing.
